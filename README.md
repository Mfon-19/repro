# Repro
Upload research papers an implement them LeetCode style.

## Features currently working
Can return a code scafford (TypeScipt) and tests. Can run those tests on Vercel Sandbox and return a result.

## Todo
[] Make webapp reliable. Kinda vague, but entails not failing
[] Make AI call faster. Currently takes about 5 minutes, but maybe users will be ok with that?
[] Add support for different languages (Go, Rust, C++, Zig, etc...)
[] Add LSPs for those new languages. Monaco supports just JS/TS and Python

Will continue working on this after judging ends
